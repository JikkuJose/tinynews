# TinyNews
A simple gem built to see the titles of various news feeds very easily. Mostly a quick and dirty version now. Probably will be refining it.

## Installation

    $ gem install tinynews

## Usage

### CLI (nothing else for now)

Usage:

    $ tinynews --NEWS_SOURCE # example: tinynews --bbc

List all news sources:

    $ tinynews list

Further info: (Nothing pretty much ;))

    $ tinynews --help for help.

## Todo:

1. Providing a configuration file in the home directory to configure news sources.
2. Provide better help
3. Format list command to include the options better.
